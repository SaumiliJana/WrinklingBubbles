# Wrinkling Bubbles
Study the wrinkling instability in bubbles
A) Newtonian Fluid
1. "wrinkling_bub_axi_v1.c" : bubble collapse axisymmetric initial experiments
2. "wrinkling_bub_3d_v1.c" :No *.vtu files generated while running, only intermediate/snapshots dumped. Run "get_vtu.sh" to obtain the *.vtu files for visualisation in Paraview
3. "wrinkling_bub_3d_v2.c": *.vtu files for 3D visualization generated along with bview snapshots while simulation is running

4. "submit.sh": job submission script for running in paramshakti cluster. [Note: compile in home and run executable in scratch, load same module version for compiling and running]
B) Viscoelastic
